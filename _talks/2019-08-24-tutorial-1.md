I presented this tutorial to 500+ attendees from different backgrounds ranging from students to mix of developers(Web, Mobile, AI, Infrastructures etc.) in Nepalâ€™s First and Biggest AI Expo. The session included the introduction to deep learning and computer vision and tutorial on building simple image recognition system with Convolutional Neural Networks. The slide for the session is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rQItxFij30autTAyCAQDI57tB0Be3ERc46pNb0D7zh8/edit?usp=sharing)  and the code is uploaded [here](https://github.com/Sushil-Thapa/AIExpo-learning-session). In addition to it, It also featured [Machine Learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BceHHTqiyG55A5UZEvE9sPtVSBNJzrULiWi88UEYVk0/edit?usp=sharing), [Deep Learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14kJvteVBmCkwmV8gYQVmYB8VnNW_4nB0Tb2dIFW5vPw/edit?usp=sharing) and [Natural Language Processing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JUFHFhnzbyYPuUUvFs2zeMfKn1bULlt19QOawU06aV0/edit?usp=sharing) as well.
