For more than 4 years, I have been working in the field of Artificial Intelligence specifically Machine Learning, and domains like Computer Vision, Recommendation systems, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, etc.
I am a graduate student at New Mexico Tech and currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant as well. Previously, I have worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Fusemachines and also an Instructor for the AI Microdegree program at Fuse AI Center, Kathmandu where I taught different Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms like Neural Networks, CNN, RNN, GAN, Reinforcement learning and more.
I got my degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Trubhuvan University, Institute of Engineering with a focus in Robotics, Bigdata, and AI.
